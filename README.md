# Clock Simulation

A fun simulation of an Analogue clock in ncurses.

Trivia: While going through my engineering course in year 2001 with C programming as one of the subjects, I came across conio.h and graphics.h on our lab computers. Trying to explore what they were I had this idea to write a C program that would simulate a clock. One of the C subject professor saw us struggling and took it upon himself to implement it but couldn't at that time. I had always wanted revisit that problem and it was always at the back of my mind but I never seriously took it up. Now 17 years later I am trying to tackle it again, but this time using ncurses on unix platform instead of graphics.h on windows. :)
